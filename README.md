# Power-System-Transient-Stability-Studies
# MATLAB Simulink models to analyze power system stability studies using swing equation.
Various cases are studied. Faults are created near the bus and at the middle of the line. Duration of a fault is varied to understand the stability of the power system.
Effect of variation of mechanical input power on system stability is also analyzed.
